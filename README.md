# Food-Planner

Food planner for my summer REU *SUPER SCUFFED

### To-Do:
* Convert it into a Website with Functionality *Never Going to Happen
* Receipt Reader R-CNN Implementation *Maybe
* Good Design & Storage Choices for Consumed, Purchased, & Current Stock 

End Goal:
Have a scent robot smell the food I am making and automatically check if I am at home to update my inventory (More energy efficient than a camera)
