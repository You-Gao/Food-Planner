# Food-Planner

Food planner for my summer REU

### To-Do:
* Convert it into a Website with Functionality *Never Going to Happen
* Receipt Reader R-CNN Implementation *Never going to happen
* Good Design & Storage Choices for Consumed, Purchased, & Current Stock  *If this doesn't happen I suck

End Goal:
Have a scent robot smell the food I am making and automatically check if I am at home to update my inventory (More energy efficient than a camera)
